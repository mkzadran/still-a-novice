```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
This is a report of us gun murder rates obtained form FBI reports. The origional data was obtained from the following wikipedia pages{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state}


```{r loading libs, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
Next, we load the data we already wrangled.
```{r, }
load ("rda/murders.rda", echo = FALSE)
```
Murder rate by state is explained in the following paragraph

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black")+
  coord_flip()
```

I hope this results in a good clean, explainable report.
